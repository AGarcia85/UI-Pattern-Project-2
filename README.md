## About the Project
My project is about some of my favorite sharks and why I like them. Most of the information can be found all over the web but I wanted to shed a little light on how these magnificent creatures are becoming endangered and why their population is steadily decreasing over the years. The atrocities that happen to this creature over corporate greed, ignorance and just straight lack of empathy for them is nauseating. I guess my fasination with  them is due to the fact that they are misunderstood and have a bad rputation despite many efforts to change the way people view them. What I'm trying to say is that I can relate to them. I hope that the way we treat not just sharks but many other animals changes or whether we beleive it or not if these animals become extinct it will cause a chain reaction and cause another mass extinction on a global scale.

### Styles
I decided to use the Modal model for this project since it seemed to better suit what I wanted to do. Also I welcome challenges and this one seemed callenging. I got my images and background from google and my videos from youtube. 

### What Could've Been Better
I think the way I set everything up could be better. This webpage layout is simple and I could probably add more information and images along with videos to further press my point. I also need to have a better understanding about DOM and how to incorporate more into my projects.

### What I Hope To Improve On
I hope to improve my layout and add more videos about these magestic creatures. Make the website more interactive and focus on making it more responsive especially for smaller screens. I seem to still have an issue on how to do that. Well I hope you enjoyed the simple website as much as I enjoyed making it.
